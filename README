sysbackup-amp:

Description:
------------
Service for Linux that automatically create, rotate and delete periodis system backups.
This program will create three types of backups:
- daily - keep last 31 backups;
- weekly - keep last 4 backups;
- monthly - keep all backups.

This program makes copy of root hierarchy to 'sysbackup' subfolder in backup folder.
After this it makes tgz archive of this copy.
At every 3rd day of month it will make monthly archive. It will be not automaticly removed.
At every saturday it will make weekly archive. Only 4 latest will be kept.
Every day it will make daily archive. Only 31 latest will be kept.
Notice that making monthly archive, it will not make weekly and daily. The same effect with weekly.
After archiving, full path to latest archive is stored in file 'sysbackup.latest'

Normally backup folder is excluded from backup (as well as /dev /proc /run /sys /tmp).
User can specify additional excluded folders.
